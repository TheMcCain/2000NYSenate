With Bill Clinton's first term wrapping up, all eyes are on this lucrative open seat that is now up for grabs. <br><br> On July 7, 1999, the First Lady of the United States, Hillary Clinton, formally announced an exploratory committee to run for the Senate. Though New York is solidly blue at the federal level, this election has already become a media spectacle. Mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani, has already expressed interest in running for the open seat as well. Whoever comes out on top, this election is sure to be generational, one way or another.",
